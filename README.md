# Purpose
This project is meant to be a practice project for working with the cloud. 

# What is happening?
I am using CodePipeline to automatically deploy to an S3 bucket [https://devinstormharris.s3.amazonaws.com/index.zip/index.html] when I push my code. The code is my resume that I wrote with HTML and CSS. I use CloudFront to enable HTTPS.
